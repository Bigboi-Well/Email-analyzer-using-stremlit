# 📧 Email Analyzer – AI-Powered Workshop Project

This project was developed as part of my **college workshop (Day 4: Streamlit + AI)**.  
It demonstrates how to build an **AI-powered email analysis tool** that can:

- ✍️ Let users write emails  
- 🤖 Analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)  
- 🛡️ Detect potential phishing attempts  
- 📊 Show statistics and visualizations  
- 💾 Save everything to a JSON database  

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **guided project from a workshop**. I did not build it completely on my own, but I worked through the implementation and learned a lot in the process.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Python file handling & JSON databases  
- Using **TextBlob** for AI-powered sentiment analysis  
- Detecting phishing keywords in text  
- Building **interactive web apps** with **Streamlit**  
- Creating dashboards with charts and statistics  
- Structuring a project (database → logic → interface)
